        <h3>La La Land, and why it's my favourite movie</h3>
        <p>La La Land was made back in 2016 and remains one of my favourite movies. It is a musical
            that features an aspiring jazz musician and "soon to be" actress. The movie incorporates many forms
            of jazz and awesome melodies that will keep you hooked! The cinematography is absolutely perfect and
            just added more layers to my enjoyement towards the movie.

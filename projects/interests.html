        <h2>La La Land, and why it's my favourite movie</h2>
        <p>La La Land was made back in 2016 and remains one of my favourite movies. It is a musical
            that features an aspiring jazz musician and "soon to be" actress. The movie incorporates many forms
            of jazz and awesome melodies that will keep you hooked! The cinematography is absolutely perfect and
            just added more layers to my enjoyement towards the movie. 
        </p>
        <h2>Main Cast</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ryan Gosling as <em>Sebastian "Seb" Wilder</em></li>
        <li>Emma Stone as <em>Amelia "Mia" Dolan</em></li>
        <li>John Legend as <em>Keith</em></li>
        <li>J. K. Simmons as <em>Bill</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I personally think that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as the main leads was the only option as those 2 were the only ones
        that could pull it off. Emma Stone also got an Oscar because of her performace in La La Land. As for Ryan Gosling, he played an
        amazing role and even took the time to learn the piano just for the movie. Overall, they both had amazing chemistry and gave life to the
        entire movie.

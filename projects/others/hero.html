        <div class="emphasize"><h2>My Hero's Name is Christopher Lloyd </h2></div>
        <p>My hero is Christopher Lloyd. He is someone I truly admire as an actor. He has
            played many roles of classic movies and has brought so much color and emotion into his
            characters. Not to mention, he has an amazing voice that is able to set the tone and demeanor of 
            whoever he's playing. Although he did not play a role in La La Land, his influence in the movie industry is what 
            shaped La La Land as an iconic movie today.

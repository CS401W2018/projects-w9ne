    <h1>My Favourite Band</h1>
        <p>IV of Spades is my favourite band to listen to. The band originated from the Philippines and are most famous
        for their <strong>"pop funk"</strong> style of music. They also popular because of their <em>1970s style outfits and music videos</em>. Some of their notable songs are 
        <em>Mundo</em> and <em>Where Have You Been My Disco.</em> The Band has been around since 2014 but gained more exposure early 2018. IV of Spades consists of
        4 members, their names are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unique Salonga</li>
            <li>Zild Benitez</li>
            <li>Blaster Silonga</li>
            <li>Badjao de Castro</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unfortunately in 2018, their lead vocalist, Unique Solonga, decided to leave the band in search for his own personal
        career. IV of Spades continued to operate without Unique but ultimately went on hiatus in late 2020. Aside from that, their songs remain
        a classic and is still very funky and catchy to listen to. Here are my 5 favourite songs from them: 
        </p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Hey Barbara</li>
            <li>Mundo</li>
            <li>Come Inside Of My Heart</li>
            <li>Where Have You Been My Disco</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote><i>Oh my love You don't have to listen to a word they say, <br>'Cause all that really matters is that I love you, 
        I really do."</i>

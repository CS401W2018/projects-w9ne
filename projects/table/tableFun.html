            <h4>This is a Summary of the sales from the Band "IV of Spades"</h4>
            <p>We see that through the years, IV of spade has become more and more popular and has gained an active following.
            The band has steadily gained favour and has it's most popular track, "Where have you been my disco" on the very top.
            As 2020 approaches, the band creates a new album but decides to not release it to the public. Many fans have copies of this unreleased album
            and since then has created small following for their latest songs.

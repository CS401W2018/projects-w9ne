    <h1>This is how CSS works and why it's important</h1>
        <p>We use CSS for a security measure and it is good</p>

        <h3>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS>?</h3>
        <p>Inline is what is changed inside of the HTML file. Embedded is what is changed above the head of the 
            HTML file. External is a completely other file that allows us to change something via link (in head)

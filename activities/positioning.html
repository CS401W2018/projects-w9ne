    <p>Engagement Assignment</p>
    <p>1. Block elements take up an entire space of which is available, an example of this is div, p, and many others. Inline tags do the same, but they do not
        force the an entirely new line to be created. An example of this is span or images. </p>
    <p>2. Normal flow the the way pictures and videos are rendered into our code.</p>
    <p>3. A float specifies that our object gets taken out of the normal flow. We are able to clear it using the clear id</p>
    <p>4. Relative makes sure that it changes the position but stays in the relative flow, absolute removes it from the flow, but is close to
        its closest element, fixed makes sure that the image or video stays in the position of the page, even if it is moved
    </p>
    <p>5. We can make nice links for mobile devices by making the links have a hover option and thicker area 
        for users to click on. 
    </p>
    <p>We can find videos of what we learned in the modules and rewatch them for reference</p>

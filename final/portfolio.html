            <p>Here are many projects and dreams which I wish to do in the future and projects which I am currently working on.
                I have seperated my own projects from my "dream" projects in the projects tab right <a href="myProjects.html">here</a>. I hope everyone can resonate
                with these projects and hopefully choose to partner up with me in making a project together!

                <p>There is a particular way of helping people with conflict other that the more known methods like therapy or counselling. Mediation is an
                    alterantive but effective way to help people come together and see each other eye to eye. There may even be better reconcilliation compared to
                    therapy and counselling. That is why I want to try to make a website that can help people sign up and meet with Mediators faster than ever before.
                    An example of this website would be <a href="https://familysolutionscounselingga.com/online-meetings/">Family Solutions Conselling</a>. They offer a great chance
                    at meeting Mediators through their online platform.

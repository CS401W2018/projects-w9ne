            <p>"This is one of my most favourite temples because of the special experience that comes with it. I was able to get my endowment
                here in Cebu, Phillippines. This was also during my mission and it was also during COVID, which meant that access to the temple was limited.
                I was able to be blessed to enter into the temple during such a difficult time." </p>

            <h2>What is a company I'm hoping to join?</h2>
            <p>A company that I want to work for is FamilySearch. They use many different languages but they focus on building
                beautiful amazing websites that help other people connect with their ancestors and even build their family trees. They
                have developed an amazing system to keep track and even look up their ancestors which many have been lost to poor recording
                or lost to time. I've always wanted to work for an organization that helps people in an amazing positive way. They use a a lot of
                JavaScript and Python in making their apps and software so I hope I will be able sharpen my coding skills and work for them in the
                future.
